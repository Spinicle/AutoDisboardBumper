Things to have at ready - 
  Account in https://repl.it/, https://uptimerobot.com/ & Discord account token (Google if you don't know how to get it).

Create a new python repl and drag and drop all files into the repl.
Then, in .env add you token (Ex. BOT_TOKEN=EXAMPLETOKEN).
Go back to main.py, run it, then wait for dependancies to install.
Copy the link that comes in the window above the console and head to uptimerobot and follow the instructions given here :
  https://repl.it/talk/learn/How-to-use-and-setup-UptimeRobot/9003

Once done, re-run the repl (Stop it and then start, just so no errors occur).

HAVE FUN!
